                <p className="about__subtitle">I am Vedant Dinkarrao Dabhade, a final year engineering student, pursuing my Bachelor’s degree I started web developement in second year of Engineering. I have a strong interest for design. Typically. I always consider my work to be art. As an artist, I think it’s important to always experiment with technical abilities and use them in a creative way.
                </p>

                <p className="about__subtitle"> I’m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
